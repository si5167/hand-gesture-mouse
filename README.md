# hand-gesture-mouse
A new approach for controlling mouse movement using a real-time camera. Most of the existing approaches involve changing mouse parts such as adding more buttons or changing the position of the tracking ball. Instead, we propose to change the hardware design. Our method is to use a camera and computer vision technology, such as image segmentation and gesture recognition, to control mouse tasks (left click and right click, selection, scroll and drag). Hand gestures are acquired using Web camera based on colour detection. In our project, three colour tapes are used on fingers. The tapes will be used for clicking events of the mouse. Through Web camera the real time video is captured. Image processing is performed on each frame of that video to detect the colour and mouse tasks are performed.
